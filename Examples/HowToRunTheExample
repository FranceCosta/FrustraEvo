After downloading all the files in the folder: https://github.com/proteinphysiologylab/FrustraEvo/tree/master/Examples/ you have to do the following:

In the case that you want to generate frustration logo and contactmaps (for mutational and configurational) please use the run_logo_complete.py file.
1. Put in the same directory: run_logo_complete.py, NOP_ginsi.fasta and the PDBs_GinsiNOP folder (optional, here you can copy also the Scripts folder (https://github.com/proteinphysiologylab/FrustraEvo/tree/master/Scripts))
2. Into the run_logo_complete.py you need to set the path to the Functions.py file (in this line: sys.path.append('')#Path to Functions.py file).
3. Open a terminal in the the directory created in the first step and run:
  `$python3 run_logo_complete.py NOP_Ginsi Path_To_Scripts_Folder/ NOP_ginsi.fasta P0A593 PDBs_GinsiNOP`
  
After the script finishes the frustration logo and the contact maps will be located in the FrustraEvo_NOP_Ginsi/OutPutFiles folder
