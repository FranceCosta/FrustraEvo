For the KRAS family we have used two datasets. 1) that corresponds to the RAS cluster from the Rojas et al, 2012 article (reduced_KRAS.zip) and 2) an automatically generated dataset for which homologous proteins were retrieved with a pipeline. 

The 2nd dataset is too big to be uploaded on GitHub. That dataset will be uploaded to ZENODO upon publication
