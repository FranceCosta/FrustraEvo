# FrustraEvo: A Tool To Study Energetic Patterns Within And Between Protein Families

FrustraEvo is a very simple tool to calculate the frustration logo and the furstration contact maps. As a input files receives a set of aligned sequences (MSA) and their corresponding structures and calculates the degree of frustration conservation across them, per position or contact using the frustratometeR.
